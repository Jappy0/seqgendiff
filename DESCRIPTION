Title: Sequence Generation/Modification for Differential Expression Analysis Simulations
Version: 0.2.1
Authors@R: person("David", "Gerard", email = "dgerard@american.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Generates/modifies RNA-seq data for use in simulations. We provide
    a suite of functions that will add a known amount of signal to a real 
    RNA-seq dataset. The advantage to using this approach over simulating under
    a theoretical distribution is that common/annoying aspects of the data
    are more preserved, giving a more realistic evaluation of your method. 
    The main functions are thin_diff(), thin_lib(), thin_gene(), and 
    thin_2group().
